                            <p>Chuck’s connection to Africa began with his birth, but the artistic connection began with a performance of the Sierra Leone National Dance Company at the New York World’s Fair in 1964. Study in Africa became a goal. The opportunity came in 1977 when the Chuck Davis Dance Company participated in FESTAC, an international exposition and celebration of African culture, held in Lagos, Nigeria. Each year thereafter,  he has returned to the continent for further study of traditional dance styles and music.</p>

                            <p>Each season from 1980 to 1984 the Chuck Davis Dance Company was in residence with the American Dance Festival’s Community Services Program and each season the participants in this outreach program grew. By 1983 it had become obvious that there was a developing core of local dancers whose levels of proficiency were approaching those of the professionals from whom they were learning. The African American Dance Ensemble was born. The Ensemble’s “arrival” was in February 1984 when they gave their first full concert as an independent professional company. In the 1985 season of the American Dance Festival, the African American Dance Ensemble stood on its own and took its place among the other established companies when it premiered two new Chuck Davis works, “Saturday Night, Sunday Morning,” and “Drought,” both of which were commissioned by the American Dance Festival.
